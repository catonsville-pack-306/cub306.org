## Car Creation Guidelines
**For safety purposes and to protect the race track from damage, cars:**

1) May not interfere with any other cars in the race;
2) May not use any type of combustion (e.g. no rockets, no internal combustion engines, nothing burning);
3) Must fit under the timing gate at the end of the track (we will get you the dimensions ASAP);
4) May only use dry lubricants (e.g. powdered graphite)
