## <i class="fas fa-paw"></i> What is Cub Scouts ##
![Webelos][webs2]
![Lions][lion]
Cub scouts is an extension of BSA Scouts and is focused on elementary age kids. BSA Scouts is what most people think about when they hear "Scouts" and that program is focussed on Middle School and High School kids.

Cub Scouts is broken down into "Dens" by grade and given names:

## <i class="fas fa-hiking"></i> Our Activities ##

We meet every Wednesday during the school year and once a month durring the summer. In our weekly Den meetings scouts learn citizenship, character, and leadership. Once a month we also meet as a whole Pack. These are called Pack Meetings.

NOTE: we are currently meeting on line for the first half of the year, however our plans will change quickly if the world improves. See our [Covid News](/events/2020-2021/covid/) page for details.

### <i class="fas fa-campground"></i> Camping ###
![Camping][foodme]
![Camping][fire]

Twice a year we do "family camping". These take place in the fall and the spring. Family camping means scouts and at least one gardian attend, however the entire family is invited. Scouts need to attend at least one camping event for their rank requirements but are encouraged to join both. Camping events are a great way to connect with nature, go on hikes and learn the basics of fire safety, cooking, and team work.

<br style="clear:both">

## <i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt"></i> Becoming a Scout ##
![Racing Day][race]

1. filling out an [signup questionnaire][signup_form],
1. filling out an [application form][signup_form] (new scouts only),
2. filling out a [health form][health_form],
3. pay dues on our [web store][web_store].]

After joining, all Scouts should own a cub scout handbook for their Den. This book show all the requirements needed to achieve the "rank" award for the age of the scout. There are required "adventures" and electives. Parents and Scouts are free to work on as many of the electives as they can. In fact, many kids are already doing qualifying activities (like learning to swim) towards awards.

* [handbooks @ scout store](https://www.scoutshop.org/nsearch/?q=cub+scout+handbook)

They will also need a uniform. Cub scouts are color coordinated by Den (grade) both for the scouts benefit and the adults. We ask that at minimum parents provide for:

* The "Class-A" Blue Uniform shirt, tan for Webelos,
* Cub Scout belt,
* Den hat,
* and Den scarf.

![Cub Scout Uniform][uniforms]

Uniforms come in long sleeve and short sleeve options. Most parents get the short sleeve and put the kid in a long sleeve undershirt.

Pants and socks are optional. Awards are warn on both Shirt and Belt so these really are a must. The color coordinated scarf and hat help the scout feel as since of belonging to their Den and it helps the adults know where the scout belongs.

Each year we also provided a "class-b" tee-shirt for use at events and activities where scouts might get dirty (we try to have many of these).
