## <i class="fas fa-paw"></i> What is Cub Scouts ##
![Webelos][webs2]
![Lions][lion]
Cub scouts is an extension of Scouts BSA and is focused on elementary age kids. Scouts BSA is what most people think about when they hear "Scouts" and that program is focused on Middle School and High School kids.

Cub Scouts is broken down into "Dens" by grade and given names:

| Icon           | Den       | Grade        | Guardian | Focus |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- | ----- |

| ![shield][str] | Tiger     | First        | Required | Participation
| ![shield][swf] | Wolf      | Second       | Drop off | Apply the principles of scoutings
| ![shield][sbr] | Bear      | Third        | Drop off | Hands on intro to tools, cooking, fire, others
| ![shield][sws] | Webelos 1 | Forth grade  | Drop off | Transition to Scouts BSA

### <i class="fas fa-campground"></i> Camping ###
![Camping][foodme]
![Camping][fire]

Twice a year we do "family camping". These take place in the fall and the spring. Family camping means scouts and at least one gardian attend, however the entire family is invited. Scouts need to attend at least one camping event for their rank requirements but are encouraged to join both. Camping events are a great way to connect with nature, go on hikes and learn the basics of fire safety, cooking, and team work.

<br style="clear:both">

## <i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt"></i> Becoming a Scout ##
![Racing Day][race]

2. filling out an [application form][bsa_app] (new scouts only),
3. filling out a [health form][health_form],
4. pay dues on our [web store][web_store].]

After joining, all Scouts should own a cub scout handbook for their Den. This book show all the requirements needed to achieve the "rank" award for the age of the scout. There are required "adventures" and electives. Parents and Scouts are free to work on as many of the electives as they can. In fact, many kids are already doing qualifying activities (like learning to swim) towards awards.

* [handbooks @ scout store](https://www.scoutshop.org/nsearch/?q=cub+scout+handbook)

They will also need a uniform. Cub scouts are color coordinated by Den (grade) both for the scouts benefit and the adults. We ask that at minimum parents provide for:

* The "Class-A" Blue Uniform shirt, tan for Webelos,
* Cub Scout belt,
* Den hat,
* and Den neckerchief.

![Cub Scout Uniform][uniforms]

Uniforms come in long sleeve and short sleeve options. Most parents get the short sleeve and put the kid in a long sleeve undershirt.

Pants and socks are optional. Awards are worn on both Shirt and Belt so these really are a must. The color coordinated neckerchief and hat help the scout feel a sense of belonging to their Den and it helps the adults guide the scout to where he/she belongs.

Each year we also provided a "class-b" tee-shirt for use at events and activities where scouts might get dirty (we try to have many of these).
