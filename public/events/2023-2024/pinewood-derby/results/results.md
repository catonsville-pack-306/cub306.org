## Full Race Results

For full race results you can download these files:

* [Raw data](RaceResults.csv) as a CSV

In the PDF is a chart like the one below. The chart shows how your scouts car did for each of its runs. Each row is one scout and is listed by car number. A night grouping means the care preformed pretty much the same regardless of run, a wider gap shows more erratic results.

## Track
Plotting all the results by track shows a slight advantage to track 1 and a disadvantage on 3. This could just be either the track or the ground not being perfect, however it may have more to do with the ground as this year was not as bad as last.

This is why we make sure to run the cars evenly over all tracks.
