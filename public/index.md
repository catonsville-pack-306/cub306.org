# Cub Scout Pack 306 of Catonsville #

We welcome boys and girls from the Catonsville area in grades K-5.  Throughout the school year, we generally meet on Wednesday nights at 7 p.m., on the grounds of our gracious sponsor Catonsville Presbyterian Church.  

Our program includes traditional outdoor activities like camping and hiking, as well as engaging explorations of STEM, crafting and creating, and teaching teamwork, as well as creating an environment for important personal growth.
