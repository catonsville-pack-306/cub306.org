There is no shortage of interested youth who want to join scouts. Kids love scouts. On the other hand, parents with extra time is **very** hard to come by. As such we always need people for both large and small roles.

## <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Why Become a Leader ##
![leaders][leaderflag]

Becoming a leader is a great way to connect with your scout and to contribute to the program. The scouting program is not just for kids. You'll find that by teaching the principles of scouting to the youth, you will be learning (or remembering) it yourself.

### <i class="fas fa-people-carry"></i> Is it Hard ###
BSA provides a leader manual for each Den/Grade. In this manual you will find all the pre-written lesson plans for every "adventure". Following this will get you started on success. You can stick with the lesson plans for the entire program year, or as you get to know your scouts, you can branch off and write your own plans.

Tag teaming with the Assistent Den Leaders is also a great way to share the burden

### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Why do we need so many leaders ###

One of the reasons we need so many adults is because we follow the "[two deep leadership][two_deep]" as defined by the [BSA Youth Protection Mission Statement](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/). In short, this means we need at all times two adult leaders for all dens at all times. While currently we have all the den leaders we need, we need a couple of assistant den leaders and backup assistant den leaders all who have taken the youth protection training.

We understand that everyone is busy and we are working hard to break up tasks in to both large and small commitments to fit everyones schedule.
