<!-- Title: About Pack 306 -->

# History #

We are the cub pack associated with the [Boy Scout Troop 306](http://ourtroop306.org/).  Troop 306 was founded in 1911 and has been in continuous operations since.

Cub Scout Pack 306 has a long history, including a sad time when the pack was closed for a while. Formed in 1996, Pack 65 (founded by Don Hirst) had been hosted by the Catonsville Lutheran Church on Old Frederick Road until 2013. Finding itself without a sponsor, they were welcomed back at Catonsville Presbyterian Church. In 2017 pack 842 joined us as well. In 2019, we welcomed girls to the pack.
